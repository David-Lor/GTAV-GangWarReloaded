# GTAV-GangWarReloaded

A collection of GangWar scripts for Grand Theft Auto V (PC Only). They spawn peds on two teams that will fight each other, creating what is called a "gang war".

The script was originally created by (Kerosini @ GTA5-Mods.com)[https://www.gta5-mods.com/scripts/gangwar-zip], who made it open-source. I used that script a lot, and started improving it (my first steps into GTAV scripting). However notice that He updated the script with some interesting features, while I'm keep using the original one.
